🚀 SISTec Samadhan 2.0 – Team NeoNexis

"Not just building solutions… we’re building memories, friendships, and skills for life." ❤️

Welcome to Team NeoNexis’ corner of the Samadhan 2.0 Hackathon hosted by the Calm Chase Community!
This is more than just a repo — it’s our digital diary where we share our journey, challenges, wins, and all the little moments in between.

🎯 Our Vision

We’re here to create solutions that matter — smart, structured, and impactful.
But more importantly, we’re here to enjoy the journey, learn together, and grow as a team.

For us, the hackathon isn’t just about winning.
It’s about showing up every day, learning something new, and making the most of every moment.
